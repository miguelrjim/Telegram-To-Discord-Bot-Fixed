## Description
Forwardgram is a free and open source, telegram to discord message bot. It enables one to forward messages from Multiple Telegram channels to one (or more) Telegram/Discord channels of your own. This python bot monitors multiple telegram channels. When a new message/entity is sent, it will parse the response and forward it to a discord channel using your own personalized bot. It will also forward the same message to your own Telegram channel.


### Dependencies

3. Create you own discord bot, add it to your server and retrive token. Follow Steps [here](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/).
4. Have a Telegram account with valid phone number


### Installing and Setup

2. Open your choice of console (or Anaconda console) and navigate to cloned folder
